### Milestone 3 
# Cameron Reaves

Create an Rmd/html which provides a draft of your About page. All of your data processing should be complete. Remember: You must gather data from two or more different sources. 

Raw data, stored in file = "raw-data",  is cleaned and stored in file = "clean-data". 

I will merge the climate data with an SF datafrane from the urbanmapr package, which will map net migration by county in the United States. 

I will merge the climate, zillow, and opportunity atlas dataframes, and create a metric to discover counties where you should move (variables are housing price index and upward mobiility).
